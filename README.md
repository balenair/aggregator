## Setup

This project is designed to run on an x86 device using balenaCloud, but can easily be modified for use on an Arm device such as a Raspberry Pi. It is also a great project to deploy to a [balena AMI](https://blog.balena.io/balenaOS-aws-ami-support/) if you don't have (or don't want to maintain) a physical device.
